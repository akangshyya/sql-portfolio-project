# 🚀 Advanced SQL Data Analytics & Reporting Project

This project demonstrates **expertise in solving complex business problems using advanced SQL techniques**, focusing on deriving deep insights, establishing customer segments, and building robust analytical data models for downstream Business Intelligence (BI) tools.

---

## ✨ Project Overview

This project showcases an **end-to-end analytical SQL workflow** — from raw transactional data to strategic business reporting.  
It covers advanced analytical topics such as trend analysis, customer segmentation, and performance benchmarking using **window functions, CTEs, and subqueries**.

## 📊 Project Highlights & Key Analytical Areas

| **Analytical Area** | **Description** | **Core SQL Techniques** |
|----------------------|-----------------|--------------------------|
| **Time-Series & Trend Analysis** | Implemented Year-over-Year (YoY), Month-over-Month (MoM), and cumulative metrics to track sales performance, identify long-term trends, and understand seasonality. | `WINDOW FUNCTIONS`, `DATEPART`, `LAG` |
| **Performance Comparison** | Conducted period-over-period and value-to-target comparisons to measure product and category success. | `LAG()`, `LEAD()`, `CASE WHEN` |
| **Customer Segmentation** | Created custom customer segments (VIP, Regular, New) based on spending behavior and active lifespan, forming the basis for targeted marketing strategies. | `CASE WHEN`, `CTEs` |
| **Part-to-Whole Analysis** | Calculated the proportional contribution of product categories to total sales to identify top revenue drivers. | `SUM() OVER()` (unpartitioned) |

## 💡 Business Value & Deliverables

The final deliverables include **pre-aggregated, denormalized analytical views** ready for direct use in BI tools (like Power BI, Tableau, or Excel).

### 📈 Customer Report View — `Report_Customers`
A comprehensive 360° customer profile, including:
- **Customer Segments:** VIP, Regular, New  
- **Core KPIs:**  
  - Recency (months since last order)  
  - Average Order Value (AOV)  
  - Average Monthly Spend  

### 📦 Product Report View — `Report_Products`
Detailed product-level performance metrics:
- **Revenue Segments:** High, Medium, Low  
- **Key Metrics:**  
  - Total Sales  
  - Total Orders  
  - Average Monthly Revenue

## 🛠️ Technology Stack

- **Database Language:** Advanced SQL (T-SQL / PostgreSQL concepts)
- **Core Techniques:**  
  `Window Functions (LAG, LEAD, SUM() OVER)`, `CTEs`, `Subqueries`, `CASE WHEN`
- **Modeling Approach:**  
  Creation of pre-aggregated, denormalized **reporting views** for efficient analysis.

## 📁 Repository Structure

| **File Name** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| `sql_advanced_analytics_scripts.sql` | Main script containing all complex analytical queries and report view creation. |
| `report_creation_summary.pdf` | Documentation summarizing logic, KPIs, and business rules for customer & product segmentation. |
| `data_schema_setup.sql` | Script to initialize the database schema (Fact & Dimension tables). |

## 🧭 How to Explore the Code

1. **Start** with `data_schema_setup.sql` to create your database schema.  
2. **Run** `sql_advanced_analytics_scripts.sql` step by step — each section is **fully commented** for clarity.  
3. **Review** the intermediate queries that calculate trend metrics, customer lifespan, and spending patterns.  
4. **Explore** the final `CREATE VIEW` statements for `Report_Customers` and `Report_Products`.
